## The version 37 introduce a new and improved game lists enviroment!

The options structure for game lists has been simplified by removing image options specific to each view type. Now there are only two universal options: main image and grid image. Additionally, a new option has been added to hide game descriptions and all information. The screen layout will automatically adapt to all possible combinations. 

Two new gamelist layouts have been included: Classic Carousel, which emulates the classic Ps4 layout, and Full Grid, which takes up more screen space and displays more elements.

This new game list system combines the following options: 5 view types (detailed, grid, horizontal carousel, classic carousel, and full grid), all scraped image formats for both the main position and within the grid (image, thumbnail, marquee, fanart, boxart, boxback, cartridge, and titleshot, or none), 5 ways to display game videos (window, background video, within the grid, and overlay, or none), background fanart, and the ability to hide or show game descriptions and extra information. And of course, all adapted to the screen aspect ratios already supported by the theme.

One system, one layout!
The select button is your friend...

You can customize each system with a completely personalized view. Simply press the select button on your controller (or compatible key) while in a game list to access the specific gamelist settings. From here, you can change the list type (detailed, grid, carousel etc.) and configure it with many custom theme options, such as displaying any type of scraped image or simply hiding it. You can also hide game descriptions or extra information, enable video modes, grid animations, background fanart, etc. Let your imagination run wild, now you have dozens of combinations that will make your environment truly dynamic and different.

Alongside all this, a new utility has been added, a game list called "Game Media Tester." By activating this list, you can quickly check the Batocera-compatible media assigned to each game in a very clear way.

### USE ANOTHER BACKGROUND MUSIC

If the chill audio that comes with the theme doesn't suit you, you can place your favorite music files in /_theme_music/ folder. (.ogg and .mp3 are allowed). 

You can also activate the default music tracks from batocera turning off the "play system-specific music" option under the batocera "sound settings" menu ;)



### ENABLE NAVIGATION SOUNDS

Playstation-X has specific navigation sounds to enrich the user experience. Batocera has this feature disabled by default. You can activate the navigation sounds in "Enable navigation sounds" option under the batocera sound menu.
