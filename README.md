## Important notice to the theme Version 39 and next
**Warning:** Due to substantial changes in the source code of Batocera EmulationStation regarding theme building, the theme version 39 is only compatible with Batocera 39 or RetroBat 6 and next versions. If you encounter issues, please update your frontend or downgrade to an earlier version of the theme.

## An improved game lists enviroment!

Since version 37 the game list combines the following theme options: 6 view types (detailed, grid, horizontal carousel, ps4Style carousel, full grid and Game by game), all scraped image formats for both the main position and within the grid (image, thumbnail, marquee, fanart, boxart, boxback, cartridge, and titleshot, or none), 5 ways to display game videos (window, background video, within the grid, and overlay, or none), background fanart, and the ability to hide or show game descriptions and extra information. And of course, all adapted to the screen aspect ratios already supported by the theme.

One system, one layout!
The select button is your friend...

You can customize each system with a completely personalized view. Simply press the select button on your controller (or compatible key) while in a game list to access the specific gamelist settings. From here, you can change the list type (detailed, grid, carousel etc.) and configure it with many custom theme options, such as displaying any type of scraped image or simply hiding it. You can also hide game descriptions or extra information, enable video modes, grid animations, background fanart, etc. Let your imagination run wild, now you have dozens of combinations that will make your environment truly dynamic, fresh and different.

Alongside all this, a new utility has been added, a game list called "Game Media Tester." By activating this list, you can quickly check the Batocera-compatible media assigned to each game in a very clear way.

I hope you enjoy the theme! Hard work has been done to improve the user experience and offer more customization options for gamelist. I invite you to try all the possible combinations and discover how you can create a dynamic environment tailored to your preferences.

Have fun with retro gaming!

You can also use a fully customized username and image, for this you will find two files in the theme root folder.

- To change the avatar image simply overwrite the PNG file named "custom-avatar.png" (work best with square format)

- To change the username string, open the file "custom-username.xml" with a text editor and change "username" for the desired nick

- To apply don't forget to set in theme options "Choose a nick -> custom" and/or "Choose your avatar -> custom"

### USING ANOTHER BACKGROUND MUSIC

If the chill audio that comes with the theme doesn't suit you, you can place your favorite music files in /_theme_music/ folder. (.ogg and .mp3 are allowed). 

You can also activate the default music tracks from batocera turning off the "play system-specific music" option under the batocera "sound settings" menu ;)



### ENABLE NAVIGATION SOUNDS

Playstation-X has specific navigation sounds to enrich the user experience. Batocera has this feature disabled by default. You can activate the navigation sounds in "Enable navigation sounds" option under the batocera sound menu.
